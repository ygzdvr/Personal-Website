- Conducted cutting-edge research alongside MIT Emeritus Professor Dr. Nihat Berker, focusing on the intricate dynamics of phase changes and renormalization group theory.
- Applied complex statistical mechanics principles to simulate systems of spins, utilizing Python and NumPy for the computation of phase transitions and scaling micro-level alignments to macro-scale phenomena.
- Calculated and graphically represented phase spaces and diagrams for spin systems using an innovative adaptation of the Migdal-Kadanoff approximation for the q-state Potts model.
- Authored a research article as the primary author, contributing to the esteemed American Physics Society's Physical Review, marking a significant contribution to the field of physics.
- Demonstrated a profound ability to translate theoretical physics concepts into computational models, significantly advancing the understanding of phase transitions within the scientific community.
