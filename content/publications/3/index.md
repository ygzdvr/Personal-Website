The Triangulum Galaxy (M33) is the third most massive galaxy in the Local Group (after the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies). It is an actively star-forming dwarf spiral galaxy and is located at a distance of 859 kpc. M33's relatively face-on orientation makes it ideal for studying the distribution of stars and gas in its well-defined spiral structure. It houses some of the largest known stellar nurseries, sites of the birth of short-lived but massive stars, dispersed along loose spiral arms that twist into the core. Hot young stars in these star-forming regions ionize the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) making M33 an excellent laboratory for the study of the energetics of the ISM. In this the second of a series of three AAS posters, we present a study of the physical and chemical properties of the ionized gas component of M33's ISM. The study uses the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) multi-slit ...
