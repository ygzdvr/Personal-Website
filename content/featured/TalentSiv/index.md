TalentSiv addresses the challenge of hiring qualified software engineers in the tech industry. Traditional vetting tools, such as generic algorithm questions or in-house tests, are either too broad or too resource-intensive, often failing to identify candidates who truly match the business's needs.

Our solution is an AI-powered platform that generates, deploys, and evaluates customized technical assessments. These assessments are tailored to the specific requirements of the hiring company, ensuring a better alignment between a candidate's skills and the job role.
