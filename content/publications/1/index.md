The Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the Keck II 10-meter telescope on Manua Kea in Hawaii is one of the most powerful instruments in the world for obtaining spectra of faint objects at visible wavelengths. As such, DEIMOS has been a workhorse instrument for a large community of Keck observers since it was commissioned on the telescope nearly two decades ago. Since Keck and DEIMOS are ground based, the spectra are affected by the Earth's atmospheric emission lines, or airglow.

In this the first of a series of three AAS posters, we present an automated method for optimizing atmospheric airglow subtraction which is useful for spectroscopic studies of faint astrophysical targets. Using DEIMOS multi slit spectroscopic data from the Triangulum Extended (TREX) survey that contains emission lines associated with ionized gas in the disk of M33, we have developed mask design procedures ...
