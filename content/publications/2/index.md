The Triangulum galaxy (M33) is one of the spiral galaxies in the Local Group. It is smaller and less massive than the other two members of the Local Group, the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies. M33 is a spiral galaxy at a distance of about 859 kpc. Given its proximity to the Milky Way, M33 plays an important role in our understanding of the formation and evolution of relatively low mass spiral galaxies. In this third poster of a series of three AAS posters, we present a study of the rotational kinematics of M33's ionized gas disk.

The study uses the Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) spectroscopic data from the TREX surveyâ€”specifically serendipitously detected emission lines associated with the ionized phase of M33's interstellar medium. As explained in the first poster of this series, we have carried out optimal subtraction of the atmospheric airglow emission lines from these sky spectra. In this the ...
