Harmony is an innovative social networking platform focused on music as the primary medium of connection. Unlike conventional social media, Harmony emphasizes individualized experiences and connections based on musical tastes rather than followers or popularity.

Harmonyâ€™s backend architecture incorporates advanced technologies: React Native for a cross-platform mobile experience, Pinecone API for handling high-dimensional vector data, and OpenAI API for generating and embedding user vectors.
